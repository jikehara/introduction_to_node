## My first commit!
### This is all notes.

Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript ~~runtime built~~ on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

A **Node Module** is a modular application of code. This allows it to fit into other parts of code, like an assembly line of code with multiple replaceable parts.

**NPM** is Node Package Manager. It's a tool the lets us access the node module ecosystem and add them to our code.

A **package.json** is the master file the keeps track of all the useful node modules for a project.

To add a `package.json` to a project, run the commandc `npm init` and accept all defaults.
